This is a mini package to help you find cheaters by comparing
hand-ins\!  
([Read

about the circumstances that brought about the development of this
package.)

## Download and Install

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cheatR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cheatR)
[![downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/cheatR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cheatR)

You can install `cheatR` with:

``` r
install.packages("cheatR")
```

Or get the dev version from
[github](https://github.com/mattansb/cheatR):

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("mattansb/cheatR")

See the [*using
`cheatR`*](https://mattansb.github.io/cheatR/articles/using-cheatR.html)
vignette, or use the accompanying `Shiny` app that can either be run
locally

``` r
cheatR::catch_em_app()
```

Or can be found on

## Limitations?

  - As far as we can tell, this should work on any language; we tried
    both English and Hebrew, with and without setting
    `Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Hebrew")`.  
  - Best performance was achieved on `R` version \> 3.5.0.
