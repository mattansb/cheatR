This is a mini package to help you find cheaters by comparing hand-ins!  
([Read more](https://shouldbewriting.netlify.com/posts/2018-07-29-cheatr/) about the circumstances that brought about the development of this package.)

## Download and Install

[![CRAN](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/cheatR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cheatR)

You can install `cheatR` from [github](https://github.com/mattansb/cheatR) with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattansb/cheatR")
```

## Example usage

<!-- generated from the vignette. Please see that file -->

```{r child = 'vignettes/using-cheatR.Rmd'}
```

### Shiny app!

The accompanying `Shiny` app can be found on [shinyapps.io](https://almogsi.shinyapps.io/cheatR/), but can also be run locally with:

```R
cheatR::catch_em_app()
```

## Limitations?
  
  - As far as we can tell, this should work on any language; we tried both English and Hebrew, with and without setting `Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "Hebrew")`.  
  - Best performance was achieved on `R` version > 3.5.0.
